# Correlation Between Several Game Attributes and the Revenue Generated on Steam

The Steam database provides a vast amount of publicly available user data to analyze. It includes information on game developers, genre tags, user review scores, and—most importantly—the number of user ratings, from which we can estimate units sold and revenue generated. We can also access the professional review scores of a game from Metacritic website.

The goal of this project is to determine the potential correlation between the user reviews, professional reviews, genre of the game, the budget of the game (whether it was developed by a large studio of hundreds of employees or by a small team) with the revenue generated, thus find out what factors influence the financial success of a game.

## Data I will be using:

**Game Developers:** I will analyze if a game developed by a well-known studio financially succeeds, even if the product is not as highly rated compared to their other products. 

**Genre-Tags:** I will investigate if specific genres tend to perform better than others, or is it mostly dependent on the quality of the product, regardless of the genre.

**Metacritic and User Ratings:** Metacritic is a platform that collects the reviews from several media organizations and combine them into a final rating of the game by taking the average while Steam allows players who bought the game to leave a positive or negative review and displays the percentage of positive reviews in the game’s store page. My goal is to explore if and how these ratings influence a game’s success, and which of the two (user reviews or professional reviews) has a stronger correlation with financial success.

**Revenue Generated:** Estimating revenue is a key part of this project. Many publishers do not publicly share their revenues, but we can estimate a game’s revenue by using the number of user reviews on Steam. On average, 1 out of 50 people who buy a game leave a review. By multiplying the number of reviews by 50, we can estimate the total number of sales, and then multiply that by the game’s price to get gross revenue.

From this, we subtract:

- **10%** for sales-based discounts
- **5%** for returns
- **5%** for regional price adjustments
- **30%** Steam’s cut

This formula gives us the final net revenue generated by the game, which is almost half of the gross revenue!

## How I plan to extract Data

**Game Developers and Genre Tags:** Data can easily be extracted fromt the store page by using web scraping and visualizing with pandas and numpy libraries.

**Steam Reviews:** This is a bit trickier since reviews are loading as you scroll down and dynamically change but we don't need the reviews themselves, only the percentage of positive reviews, which can also be extracted from the store page directly by web scraping.

**Metacritic Reviews:** Like Steam reviews, metacritic ratings can also be extracted from the website using web scraping.
